# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the server

```bash
docker compose up -d          # start (auto-reloads on file changes via uvicorn --reload)
docker compose logs -f        # tail server logs
docker compose down           # stop
```

The volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` means edits to any file are live immediately — no rebuild needed unless `requirements.txt` changes.

## Architecture overview

Tensies is a real-time multiplayer dice game. There is no database — game state lives in two in-memory dicts defined in `server/state.py`:

```python
games: dict[str, dict]               # game_code → game state
connections: dict[str, dict[str, WebSocket]]  # game_code → {player_id: ws}
```

Games are destroyed when the last player disconnects.

### WebSocket message protocol

**Client → server** (`action` field):
| action | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | create new game; payload: `name` |
| `join` | join existing game; payload: `name`, `code` |
| `start` | host starts the game (host only) |
| `roll` | roll unlocked dice |
| `roll_done` | client signals its reveal animation has completed |

**Server → client** (`type` field):
| type | description |
|------|-------------|
| `welcome` | connection established; contains `player_id` |
| `state` | full game state snapshot |
| `round_won` | state snapshot with `winner_name`; triggers overlay |
| `error` | `msg` field with human-readable reason |

The full state snapshot shape is defined by `state_msg()` in `server/game.py`. It includes `target`, `round_num`, `started`, `host`, and a `players` dict with `name`, `dice`, `wins`, `has_rolled`, and `roll_count` per player.

### Delayed broadcast (key design detail)

When a player rolls, the server immediately sends the result back to **only that player** so their reveal animation can start. It then waits for a `roll_done` ack (or a `ROLL_ACK_TIMEOUT`-second timeout) before broadcasting the new state to everyone else. This ensures other players don't see the dice change until the roller's animation completes.

This is implemented in `delayed_broadcast()` (`server/broadcast.py`) via an `asyncio.Event` stored on the player dict as `ack_event`. The client fires `roll_done` when its reveal animation ends, handled by `handle_roll_done()` in `server/ws.py`.

### Round lifecycle

1. Host clicks Start → `handle_start` calls `deal_round()` (10 fresh dice each), sets `started=True`
2. Players roll; `apply_roll()` re-randomises unlocked dice and auto-locks any that match `target`
3. First player to lock all 10 wins the round → `handle_roll` sets `round_over=True`, sends `round_won` privately and schedules a `delayed_broadcast`
4. After `ROUND_WIN_DELAY` seconds, `delayed_broadcast` advances `target` (cycles 6→5→4→3→2→1→6), increments `round_num`, calls `deal_round()` again to clear per-round state

### Cache-busting

At import time, `server/assets.py` hashes every CSS/JS file under `static/css/` and `static/js/`, then rewrites every `/static/*.css|.js` URL in `index.html` to append `?v=<sha1[:8]>`. No build step needed — changing any static file changes the hash on the next server restart.

### Client-side animation state

The roll animation is sequenced across several flags on the shared `state` object exported by `static/js/state.js`:
- `rolling` — true while the shake animation is running
- `awaitingAck` — true while waiting for the server's roll response after the shake ends
- `pendingRollState` — holds the server's state response until the shake finishes
- `pendingWinName` / `pendingWinTarget` — held until the reveal completes, then the winner overlay is shown

`myDiceKey()` (in `dice.js`) includes `roll_count` in its fingerprint so a re-roll that lands on identical values still triggers a re-render (fixes a hang where the client couldn't detect that a new roll had arrived).

The roll button is rebuilt by `renderMyArea()` on every render, so its click handler is attached via event delegation on `#my-area` in `main.js` rather than per-render.

### Host transfer

When the host disconnects, `drop_player()` (in `server/broadcast.py`) promotes the first remaining player in the `players` dict to host and broadcasts the updated state. No explicit vote or confirmation.

## Telemetry

Every meaningful game event flows through `server.telemetry.emit()` to a Postgres event log + rollup tables, a Prometheus `/metrics` surface, and Grafana Live channels for sub-second dashboards. `emit()` is sync and non-blocking — the roll handler never awaits I/O. Full reference: [`docs/TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md).

Compose adds four services beside `web`: `postgres`, `prometheus`, `grafana` (anonymous viewer on **port 3001** to avoid colliding with other local Grafanas), and `postgres_exporter`.

Key invariants when touching the server modules:

- **Never `await` on the telemetry path.** `emit()` and Prometheus `.inc()`/`.observe()` are synchronous and safe to call from any hot path (the roll handler, `apply_roll`, broadcast). Postgres writes happen on a background task draining the queue.
- **All outbound WS frames go through `server.broadcast.send()`.** It handles JSON encoding, the per-Session `send_lock` (which prevents the Pinger task from interleaving frames with the receive-loop handler), and the outbound metric counters. Never call `ws.send_text` directly.
- **When you add a new event type or game state transition,** emit it from the relevant handler in `server/ws.py` or `server/broadcast.py` and (optionally) add a rollup handler in `server/telemetry/writer.py` keyed by the event type. Events without a handler still land in the `events` table; they just don't update rollups.
- **When you add a new metric,** define it in `server/telemetry/metrics.py` so there's one source of truth. Keep label cardinality low — never label by `user_id` or `game_code` (those go to Postgres).
- **`apply_roll()` returns a result dict** (`matched`, `newly_locked`, `rolled_values`, `dice_before/after`, `locked_before/after`). `server/game.py` stays telemetry-free; `handle_roll` consumes the rest for the `roll` event payload.
- **Dashboards live in `ops/grafana/dashboards/*.json`** and are provisioned automatically; edits in the UI don't persist across `docker compose down`.
